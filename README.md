# Forecasting Agricultural and Crop Yield on a **nation**al scale (FACYnation)
Repository for the FACYnation project.

This repository is a fork of [Peter Hurley's](https://github.com/DataJavelin/FACYnation) notebooks from the hack day conducted on October 17-18 2018 where we investigated the use of Bayesian inference to the problem of forecasting crop yields. This was part organised by data consultancy [DataJavelin](https://www.datajavelin.com/).

Eventually we aim to create a model that can be used to understand the impace of climate variation of crop yields. In notebook [3_Overview.ipynb](3_Overview.ipynb) I give an overview of the research plan to be conducted in the coming months.

Notebooks:

1. [Exploratory_analysis.ipynb](Exploratory_analysis.ipynb) Peter Hurley gives an overview of the data present.

2. [Bayesian_MSM.ipynb](Bayesian_MSM.ipynb)

3. [Overview.ipynb](Overview.ipynb) Raphael Shirley summarises the previous notebooks by Peter Hurley and implements a two dimensional Gaussian model.

4. [Bayesian_MSM_SD2.ipynb](Bayesian_MSM_SD2.ipynb) Steven freely fits the variance and shows aggreement with an assumed value.

5. [Growth_curve_fitting.ipynb](Growth_curve_fitting.ipynb) Peter implements a one dimensional Gaussian model.
