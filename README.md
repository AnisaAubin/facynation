# Forecasting Agricultural and Crop Yield on a **nation**al scale (FACYnation)
Repository for the FACYnation project.

This repository is a fork of [Peter Hurley's](https://github.com/DataJavelin/FACYnation) notebooks from the hack day conducted on October 17-18 2018 where we investigated the use of Bayesian inference to the problem of forecasting crop yields. This was part organised by data consultancy [DataJavelin](https://www.datajavelin.com/).

Iventually we aim to create a model that can be used to understand the impace of climate variation of crop yields. In notebook [3_Overview.ipynb](3_Overview.ipynb) I give an overview of the research plan to be conducted in the coming months.
